**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

## This is what i could salvage of my neovim config after i deleted all my files on linux
- I guess I'm a real linux user now
- Please hire me!  :(
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)
